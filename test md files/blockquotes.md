>Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.
Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable
as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While
Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters – including Setext, atx,
Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText – the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s
syntax is the format of plain text email.
